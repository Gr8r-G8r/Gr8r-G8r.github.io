	<p class="lyrics">I was a liar<br>
	I gave in to the fire<br>
	I know I should've fought it<br>
	At least I'm being honest<br>
	Feel like a failure<br>
	'Cause I know that I failed you<br>
	I should've done you better<br>
	'Cause you don't want a liar</p>

	<p class="lyrics">And I know, and I know, and I know<br>
	She gives you everything,<br>
	But, boy, I couldn't give it to you<br>
	And I know, and I know, and I know<br>
	That you got everything,<br>
	But I got nothing here without you</p>

	<p class="lyrics">So one last time<br>
	I need to be the one who takes you home<br>
	One more time<br>
	I promise, after that, I'll let you go<br>
	Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart<br>
	All I really care is you wake up in my arms<br>
	One last time<br>
	I need to be the one who takes you home</p>

	<p class="lyrics">I don't deserve it<br>
	I know I don't deserve it,<br>
	But stay with me a minute<br>
	I swear I'll make it worth it<br>
	Can't you forgive me?<br>
	At least just temporarily<br>
	I know that this is my fault<br>
	I should've been more careful</p>

	<p class="lyrics">And I know, and I know, and I know<br>
	She gives you everything,<br>
	But, boy, I couldn't give it to you<br>
	And I know, and I know, and I know<br>
	That you got everything,<br>
	But I got nothing here without you, baby</p>

	<p class="lyrics">So one last time<br>
	I need to be the one who takes you home<br>
	One more time<br>
	I promise, after that I'll let you go<br>
	Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart<br>
	All I really care is you wake up in my arms<br>

	At least I'm being honest (yeah)<br>
	But stay with me a minute<br>
	I swear I'll make it worth it, babe<br>
	'Cause I don't wanna be without you</p>

	<p class="lyrics">(Oh)
	So one last time<br>
	I need to be the one who takes you home (who takes you home, babe)<br>
	One more time

	Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart<br>

	<p class="lyrics">Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it<br>
	I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted<br>
	I fell right through the cracks<br>
	Now I'm trying to get back</p>

	<p class="lyrics">Before the cool done run out<br>
	I'll be giving it my bestest<br>
	And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.<br>
	I reckon, it's again my turn<br>
	To win some or learn some.</p>

	<p class="lyrics">But I won't hesitate<br>
	No more, no more.<br>
	It cannot wait,<br>
	I'm yours.</p>

	<p class="lyrics">Well, open up your mind and see like me,<br>
	Open up your plans and damn you're free.<br>
	Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.<br>
	Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family<br>
	And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved</p>

	<p class="lyrics">So I won't hesitate<br>
	No more, no more.<br>
	It cannot wait,<br>
	I'm sure.<br>
	There's no need to complicate.<br>
	Our time is short.<br>
	This is our fate,<br>
	I'm yours.</p>

	And I will nibble your ear</p>

	<p class="lyrics">I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror<br>
	And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer<br>
	But my breath fogged up the glass<br>
	And so I drew a new face and I laughed.</p>

	<p class="lyrics">I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason<br>
	To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.<br>
	It's what we aim to do.<br>
	Our name is our virtue.</p>

	Open up your plans and damn you're free.<br>
	Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.<br>
	So please don't, please don't, please don't...<br>
	There's no need to complicate.<br>
	'Cause our time is short.<br>
	This oh, this oh, this is our fate.<br>
	I'm yours.</p>

	<p class="lyrics">We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have traveled land and sea<br>
	But as long as you are with me, there's no place I'd rather be<br>
	I would wait forever, exalted in the scene<br>
	As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat</p>

	<p class="lyrics">With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay<br>
	Strolling so casually<br>
	We're different and the same, get you another name<br>
	Switch up the batteries</p>

	<p class="lyrics">If you gave me a chance I would take it<br>
	It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it<br>
	Know with all of your heart, you can't shake me<br>
	When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be<br>
	N-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be<br>
	N-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be<br>
	N-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be</p>

	<p class="lyrics">We set out on a mission to find our inner peace<br>
	Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete<br>
	It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity<br>
	As long as we're together, there's no place I'd rather be</p>

	<p class="lyrics">With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay<br>
	Strolling so casually<br>
	We're different and the same, get you another name<br>
	Switch up the batteries</p>

	<p class="lyrics">If you gave me a chance I would take it<br>
	It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it<br>
	Know with all of your heart, you can't shake me<br>
	When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be<br>
	N-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be<br>
	N-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be<br>
	N-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be</p>

	<p class="lyrics">When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be, yeah</p>

	<p class="lyrics">Beeeeeeeeee, hooooooo oh<br>
	Be [x9]<br>
	Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah, yeah, yeah</p>

	<p class="lyrics">If you gave me a chance I would take it<br>
	It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it<br>
	Know with all of your heart, you can't shake me<br>
	When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be<br>
	N-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be<br>
	N-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be<br>
	N-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be</p>

	<p class="lyrics">Such a feelin's comin' over me<br>
	There is wonder in most every thing I see<br>
	Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes<br>
	And I won't be surprised if it's a dream</p>

	<p class="lyrics">Everything I want the world to be<br>
	Is now comin' true especially for me<br>
	And the reason is clear, it's because you are here<br>
	You're the nearest thing to Heaven that I've seen</p>

	<p class="lyrics">I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation<br>
	And the only explanation I can find<br>
	Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around<br>
	Your love's put me at the top of the world</p>

	<p class="lyrics">Somethin' in the wind has learned my name<br>
	And it's tellin' me that things are not the same<br>
	In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze<br>
	There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me</p>

	<p class="lyrics">There is only one wish on my mind<br>
	When this day is through I hope that I will find<br>
	That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me<br>
	All I need will be mine if you are here</p>

	<p class="lyrics">I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation<br>
	And the only explanation I can find<br>
	Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around<br>
	Your love's put me at the top of the world</p>

	<p class="lyrics">I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation<br>
	And the only explanation I can find<br>
	Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around<br>
